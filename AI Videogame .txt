Create 1-2 page document, concisely describe how to improve the game by:
- the game dynamically adjusts the difficulty level to the user --> during actual game-play
- measuring or estimating things like --> user skill, user risk taking, tasks user's good/bad at
- having the game that adapts intelligently to the above measurements
- two people responsible for the measuring part of the code
- two people will be responsible for the game adaptation part of the code
- list who's done what in the document
- Friday, May 18 --> 1:1 feedback session
- Friday, June 8 --> Deadline, submit game


WHAT TO DO:
- Remove the feature that it gets harder
- Measure RAW DATA (see below)
- Measure of user skill = Ratio of laser's shot to asteroids hit --> higher the ratio the better the user skill
-implement new task of collecting coins for points

overall goal: surviving and shooting

Powerups (color coins?) in case user skill is low

If user skill is very high --> takes two shots to break an asteroid (these asteroids become blue FOR SURE)

RAW DATA:
- hits
- how many shots
- average speed 
- 

--> ratio of shots fired to asteroids hit 

Overall User Skill Level = ratio & average speed 

CHECKPOINTS
- Distance travelled (measured in time = 30 seconds) --> checkpoint
-score is saved at checkpoint
